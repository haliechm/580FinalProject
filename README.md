Click the link above to get to a collection of switch-accessible games. Click on any of the indivual games to play them. Most of the games can be used using the spacebar and enter key, or just directly using the two buttons on the screen. The games can be played on any device, but they work best on a desktop. Individual instructions/descriptions for each game should be read before clicking the link to each game.
