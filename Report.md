4 May noon: Projects are due. Each repo should include a Report.md which will constitute your final report. 
Your report should include a description of your project, its intended audience, the technologies, frameworks, 
libraries used, how to build and deploy it, problems encountered and future work.

**Final Report**
-----------------

**Project Description**
For our COMP580 final project at UNC, we decided to make a collection of switch-accessible games. We made several popular games switch-accessible by allowing the user to play with only two buttons and choose between a maximum of 4 choices for the majority of the games. The use of two-buttons is a common input device for individuals with motor or cognitive disabilities to access computers, so we wanted to turn games that involve either the use of multiple buttons or swiping on a tablet into games that can be played using only two buttons. 

The members in our group individually worked on the collection of games, and we combined them together to have 10 games total. The breakdown of who made which games is: 
**Meris** - PacMan, Breakout, Bloxy, and Astray
**Bea** - Mancala, 2048, and Rubik's Cube
**Halie** - Pong, DoodleJump, and Connect4

**Intended Audience**
Our intended audience is people with either motor or cognitive disabilities that make accessing a computer difficult. Many people with these types of disabilities can find it either extremely difficult or overwhelming to play games that require the use of more than two buttons or go too fast. We made all of our games accessible with only two buttons, and we made the games that have moving components pause so that the user has time to make a choice. 

**Technology, frameworks, and libraries used**

idk what to put here tbh - the games i used code from don't really seem to have used frameworks/libraries but idrk 

- CSS, HTML, & JavaScript
- Brackets, Github Desktop


Many of the games were expanded upon using outside code sources. To view each original code source for each game, check the ReadMe of the repositories. 

**How to access project**
To access the project, just click the following url:  https://haliechm.github.io/580FinalProject/
After clicking on the website, you will find a collection of switch-accessible games. Each individual game has a small description that describes how to play the game and what to expect. You can click on either the "Play Game" button or the picture to access the game. You can also view the source code for each game by clicking on the "View Source Code" button under the game description. 

**Problems encountered and future work**
Originally, our group planned to make an audio-propagated virtual reality game for people with visual impairments and to participate in Maze Day. However, we were unable to access the VR equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so we switched gears and decided to make a collection of switch-accessible games. 

We plan on continuing to fix our games after the deadline for this project - we made many games so there are a few bugs in some of the games that we plan on fixing in the future. We would like to continue to add more games to this website so that our intended audience can have a multitude of games to select from, and ideally, we want to collaborate with other groups in the class who made swtich-accessible game and combine our games to make a large collection.
